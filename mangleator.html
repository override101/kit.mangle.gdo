           I have a dream. This has been used many times since the famous speach
           it was originally said in a speach trying to accomplish a sway on the
           unequal treatment of humans based on skin differences.

           We as humans have made great progress on the race issue since the
           great Martin Luther King JR said those words in 1963. Unfortunately
          at the we have also back slid a bit to in some respects. MLKJ had his
          sights set on racial issues and equality for all people we have that
          now so i am setting my sights higher.
